# Program to calculate the average of two numbers

# Take two numbers as input
# Declare the average variable
# Delare average = (num1 + num2)/ 2
# Display ther average

# num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: \n"))
# num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: \n"))
# average = float((num1 + num2) / 2)
# print(f"The average of {num1} and {num2} is {average}")

# # Accept an age input from the user and a full name
# # If the age is less than 18 and the average is equal to 20
# # print {name}, you are not allowed to vote
# # If the age is greater than or equal to 18 and the average is greater than or 20,
# # Print {name}, you are allowed to vote
# # If the age is greater than or equal to 18 or the average is 10,
# # Print {name}, You are allowed to vote

# username = input("What is your name? \n")
